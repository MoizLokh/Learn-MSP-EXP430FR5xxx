# Learning Objective

- Understand how to use Code Composer Studios
- Understand the MSP-EXP430FR5739 board and its pherephrials
- Learn to build and debug C code on the board

# Resources

- Good tutorial (Contains a section for UART and interrupts aswell): http://www.simplyembedded.org/tutorials/
- Interrupt: https://bennthomsen.wordpress.com/engineering-toolbox/ti-msp430-launchpad/using-the-switches/
- LED: https://scienceprog.com/running-leds-on-msp-exp430fr5739-fram-board/

# Things to note

- The LED demo 01 will not work on this board as the port being used is not connected to the LED. Instead of P1 use PJ (LED1-LED4) and P3 (LED5-LED8)
